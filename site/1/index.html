is not the eternal Tao
The name that can be named
is not the (Text sourced from https://www.organism.earth/library/document/tao-te-ching) eternal Name.

The unnamable is the eternally real.
Naming is the origin
of all particular things.

Free from desire, you realize the mystery.
Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.

arise from the same source.
This source is called darkness.

Darkness within darkness.
The gateway to all understanding.</article></div></main></body></html>
